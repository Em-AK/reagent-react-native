```
$ npm install && cd react-native && npm install
$ shadow-cljs watch app

;; wait for first compile to finish or metro gets confused
$ cd react-native

$ npm start
;; and
$ react-native run-android

;; production build
$ shadow-cljs release app

;; Create Android release
$ cd react-native/android
$ ./gradlew assembleRelease
;; APK should appear at android/app/build/outputs/apk/release
;; installs in Android as "Hello App Display Name"
```

## Notes

The `react-native` folder was generated by calling `react-native init AwesomeProject` and renaming the folder.

The `:app` build will create an `react-native/app/index.js`. In `release` mode that is the only file needed. In dev mode the `app` directory will contain many more `.js` files.

`:init-fn` is called after all files are loaded and in the case of `expo` must render something synchronously as it will otherwise complain about a missing root component.
